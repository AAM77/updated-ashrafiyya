  <h2>Islamic Bioethics Program</h2>
  <p>
    The Islamic Bioethics Scholarship funds students or early researchers studying bioethical questions related to modern medicine, genetics, and public health — all through an Islamic framework. This program is perfect for students interested in research, writing, or clinical work that bridges faith and science. Projects may include topics like end-of-life care, organ donation, or Islamic perspectives on mental health.
